# ActiveQuery JavaScript

**ActiveQuery JS (v25.6.0)** is a lightweight (45 KB), ES2020-compatible, open-source framework engineered for high-performance cloud applications. 
Built on a no-conflict, modular architecture, ActiveQuery Intelligence (AQI) efficiently batches BOM/DOM updates and delegates events, eliminating the need for virtual-DOM gymnastics.

**It does not fight conventions, JavaScript Engine, Browser Object Models or your Business Logic – It works with them**. It honors browser conventions and your existing business logic, you can pick and extend only the features you need with no deep integrations required. 

Drop in any other library alongside an Active JS module, and everything works seamlessly. So, development teams stay focused on building real-world solutions, not wrestling with framework bottlenecks.
